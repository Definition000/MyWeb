HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It is the most common protocol for sending data between a web browser and a website.
## The Usage of https
We need HTTPS for 3 reasons.
Privacy, integrity, and identification.
- Privacy
	Privacy means that no one can eavesdrop on your messages.
- Integrity
	Integrity means that the message is not manipulated on the way to its destination.
- Identification
	And when you are browsing the web, identification means that the site that you are visiting is indeed the one you think it is.
